# GDSC Internal Hackathon

A gui app created using kivy python library, which has a camera in it, that detects gender,
age, and stores that information.
Next thing, app does is open a speech recognition menu, this prompts the user to tell about
the medecine they would like to find.
After that the we fire up the web scraping functions and classes to parse the data of the search
results in the websites like tata1mg, pharmeasy, and apollo.
Next we present the result to the user, asking which medecines they would like to buy.
