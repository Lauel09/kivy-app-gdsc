# GDSC Internal Hackathon

A gui app created using kivy python library, which has a camera in it, that detects gender,
age, and stores that information.
Next thing, app does is open a speech recognition menu, this prompts the user to tell about
the medecine they would like to find.
After that the we fire up the web scraping functions and classes to parse the data of the search
results in the websites like tata1mg, pharmeasy, and apollo.
Next we present the result to the user, asking which medecines they would like to buy.


## Setting up
### Install packages
[Install the spacy medical corpus from here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.4.0/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.4.0.tar.gz)


 Topics in order:
    
    1. HACKATHON PROJECT: Clean slide, with logo and maybe cross check with nandini whether we have to write the name of the hackathon.
    
    2. Intro section: From here start 3 sub headings (also include the theme of the project, Good Health and Well Being), Intro slide, team slide,and next what exactly the project is.
    
    3. Problem statement section:First, Intro to what exactly are we solving, what parts are we focusing on, and how this particular problem affects the people we intend to help (To show problems, and how severe are they, creating space for the solutions) also show the need of the solutions.
    4.Intro the solution space: Now problems have been addressed, next thing we have to do is show how unique the solution is, how it tackles the problem very efficiently. How does our solution is better, cheaper and more economic than the solutions that are available or viable around us.
   
   
    5. Future features: What we could add to the projec in the future and how these features would further help us tackle the problems we are looking at.
    For example we could further, restrict the usage of some search results for people who don't stand up to the mark itself, say someone wants medicine X which is for adults but the person is say 15, then we can deny it.
    Next thing we can add in future feature is the ability to read the prescriptions from the image file, which we can parse it usnig neural networks.

    6. Demo: Maybe we can include the demo if possible, and by Demo I mean only the screenshots of how it works.
